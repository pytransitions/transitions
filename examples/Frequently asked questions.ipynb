    "### How can I edit a graph's styling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to alter a graph's layout. Some are only available when you chose `pygraphviz` as backend. You can [1] edit `GraphMachine.machine_attributes` for Graph attributes such as flow direction and rank separation or `GraphMachine.style_attributes` for node and edge properties. The easiest way is to deepcopy the standard values and override properties you would like to change. Furthermore you can [2] work directly with the returned [pygraphviz.AGraph](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/agraph.html#pygraphviz.AGraph.edges) object that `model.get_graph()` returns. However, values set via `edge_attr` and `node_attr` will be overriden by GraphMachine.style_attributes if they haven't been reset. `AGraph.draw` features `args` as a parameter to pass arguments to Graphviz layout engine directly. Eventually, you can also get the raw dot representation (e.g. `AGraph.string()`) as a string. Some styling examples can be found in the [Graph MIxin Demo](./Graph%20MIxin%20Demo.ipynb) notebook."
