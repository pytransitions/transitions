#after_test:
#  # This step builds your wheels.
#  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
#  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
#  # interpreter

#  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
