        Args:
            model (object or list): The object(s) whose states we want to manage. If 'self',
                the current Machine instance will be used the model (i.e., all
                triggering events will be attached to the Machine itself). Note that an empty list
                is treated like no model.
            states (list): A list of valid states. Each element can be either a
                string or a State instance. If string, a new generic State
                instance will be created that has the same name as the string.
            initial (string or State): The initial state of the passed model[s].
            transitions (list): An optional list of transitions. Each element
                is a dictionary of named arguments to be passed onto the
                Transition initializer.
            send_event (boolean): When True, any arguments passed to trigger
                methods will be wrapped in an EventData object, allowing
                indirect and encapsulated access to data. When False, all
                positional and keyword arguments will be passed directly to all
                callback methods.
            auto_transitions (boolean): When True (default), every state will
                automatically have an associated to_{state}() convenience
                trigger in the base model.
            ordered_transitions (boolean): Convenience argument that calls
                add_ordered_transitions() at the end of initialization if set
                to True.
            ignore_invalid_triggers: when True, any calls to trigger methods
                that are not valid for the present state (e.g., calling an
                a_to_b() trigger when the current state is c) will be silently
                ignored rather than raising an invalid transition exception.
            before_state_change: A callable called on every change state before
                the transition happened. It receives the very same args as normal
                callbacks.
            after_state_change: A callable called on every change state after
                the transition happened. It receives the very same args as normal
                callbacks.
            name: If a name is set, it will be used as a prefix for logger output
            queued (boolean): When True, processes transitions sequentially. A trigger
                executed in a state callback function will be queued and executed later.
                Due to the nature of the queued processing, all transitions will
                _always_ return True since conditional checks cannot be conducted at queueing time.
            prepare_event: A callable called on for before possible transitions will be processed.
                It receives the very same args as normal callbacks.
            finalize_event: A callable called on for each triggered event after transitions have been processed.
                This is also called when a transition raises an exception.
