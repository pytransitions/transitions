## 0.7.0 (August 2019)

Release 0.7.0 is a major release with fundamental changes to the diagram extension. It also introduces an intermediate `MarkupMachine` which can be used to transfer and (re-)initialize machine configurations.

  - `GraphMachine` uses this representation for Graphs now and does not rely on `Machine` attributes any longer
