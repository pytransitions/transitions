# Changelog

## 0.7.0 (August 2019)

Release 0.7.0 is a major release with fundamental changes to the diagram extension. It also introduces an intermediate `MarkupMachine` which can be used to transfer and (re-)initialize machine configurations.

- Feature #263: `MarkupMachine` can be used to retrieve a Machine's dictionary representation
  - `GraphMachine` uses this representation for Graphs now and does not rely on `Machine` attributes any longer
- Feature: The default value of `State.ignore_invalid_triggers` changed to `None`. If it is not explicitly set, the `Machine`'s value is used instead.
- Feature #325: transitions now supports `pygraphviz` and `graphviz` for the creation of diagrams. Currently, `GraphMachine` will check for `pygraphviz` first and fall back to `graphviz`. To use `graphviz` directly pass `use_pygraphiv=False` to the constructor of `GraphMachine`
- Diagram style has been overhauled. Have a look at `GraphMachine`'s attributes `machine_attributes` and `style_attributes` to adjust it to your needs.
- Feature #305: Timeouts and other features are now marked in the graphs
- Bugfix #343: `get_graph` was not assigned to models added during machine runtime

## 0.6.9 (October 2018)

Release 0.6.9 is a minor release and contains two bugfixes:

- Bugfix #314: Do not override already defined model functions with convenience functions (thanks @Arkanayan)
- Bugfix #316: `state.Error` did not call parent's `enter` method (thanks @potens1)

## 0.6.8 (May, 2018)

Release 0.6.8 is a minor release and contains a critical bugfix:

- Bugfix #301: Reading `Readme.md` in `setup.py` causes a `UnicodeDecodeError` in non-UTF8-locale environments (thanks @jodal)

## 0.6.7 (May, 2018)

Release 0.6.7 is identical to 0.6.6. A release had been necessary due to #294 related to PyPI.

## 0.6.6 (May, 2018)

Release 0.6.6 is a minor release and contains several bugfixes and new features:

- Bugfix: `HierarchicalMachine` now considers the initial state of `NestedState` instances/names passed to `initial`.
- Bugfix: `HierarchicalMachine` used to ignore children when `NestedStates` were added to the machine.
- Bugfix #300: Fixed missing brackets in `TimeoutState` (thanks @Synss)
- Feature #289: Introduced `Machine.resolve_callable(func, event_data)` to enable customization of callback definitions (thanks @ollamh and @paulbovbel)
- Feature #299: Added support for internal transitions with `dest=None` (thanks @maueki)
- Feature: Added `Machine.dispatch` to trigger events on all models assigned to `Machine`

## 0.6.5 (April, 2018)

Release 0.6.5 is a minor release and contains a new feature and a bugfix:

- Feature #287: Embedding `HierarchicalMachine` will now reuse the machine's `initial` state. Passing `initial: False` overrides this (thanks @mrjogo).
- Bugfix #292: Models using `GraphMashine` were not picklable in the past due to `graph` property. Graphs for each model are now stored in `GraphMachine.model_graphs` (thanks @ansumanm).

## 0.6.4 (January, 2018)

Release 0.6.4 is a minor release and contains a new feature and two bug fixes related to `HierachicalMachine`:

- Bugfix #274: `initial` has not been passed to super in `HierachicalMachine.add_model` (thanks to @illes).
- Feature #275: `HierarchicalMachine.add_states` now supports keyword `parent` to be a `NestedState` or a string.
- Bugfix #278: `NestedState` has not been exited correctly during reflexive triggering (thanks to @hrsmanian).

## 0.6.3 (November, 2017)

Release 0.6.3 is a minor release and contains a new feature and two bug fixes:

- Bugfix #268: `Machine.add_ordered_transitions` changed states' order if `initial` is not the first or last state (thanks to @janekbaraniewski).
- Bugfix #265: Renamed `HierarchicalMachine.to` to `to_state` to prevent warnings when HSM is used as a model.
- Feature #266: Introduce `Machine.get_transitions` to get a list of transitions for alteration (thanks to @Synss).

## 0.6.2 (November, 2017)

Release 0.6.2 is a minor release and contains new features and bug fixes but also several internal changes:

- `prep_ordered_arg` is now protected in `core`
- Convert `logger` instances to `_LOGGER` to comply with protected module constant naming standards
- `traverse` is now protected in `HierarchicalMachine`
- Remove abstract class `Diagram` since it did not add functionality to `diagrams`
- Specify several overrides of `add_state` or `add_transition` to keep the base class parameters instead of `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Change several `if len(x) > 0:` checks to `if x:` as suggested by the static code analysis to make use of falsy empty lists/strings.

## 0.6.1 (September, 2017)

- Bugfix #248: `HierarchicalStateMachine`'s copy procedure used to cause issues with function callbacks and object references (thanks @Grey-Bit)
- Renamed `Machine.id` to `Machine.name` to be consistent with the constructor parameter `name`
